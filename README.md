This is my ideal vim configuration. I mostly used Eclipse to program in the past and my aim was to make my vim better than Eclipse (not hard to beet for JS, but what if I could make it better for Java also!)

This configuration gives auto completion, jsLint on saves, html completion, easy file search, etc. This coupled with the other features of vim... I really don't feel the need for any other IDE (at least until now!).

I'm pretty new at using vim to program, so this is a work in progress. This vimrc uses a bunch of nice plugins like Vundle, Tern_for_vim, YouCompleteMe, emmet, ctrlp, syntastic, Smart-Tabs, some customization and... who knows what I'll add. To install this you can pull this repository, copy the .vimrc file to your ~/.vimrc location (or better put a hard link to it -- ln pathToVimrc/.vimrc ~/.vimrc) and follow the instructions for all the plugins included. You will need to use a recent version of Vim which support python (you cay always pull vim from github also and compile it).

Have fun!
